## Image-Based Potholes Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks 


Reliable road infrastructure is a foundation for socioeconomic growth and a significant public asset. A good road system provides access to jobs, education, healthcare among other services.  It is very important to keep traffic moving smoothly to help citizens travel safely and effectively. 

Improving road safety is a vital issue for municipalities. It is crucial to continuously evaluate road conditions to establish better maintenance schedules and allocate maintenance budgets. With changing weather conditions, roads deteriorate fast which lead to higher incidences of traffic accidents, making the public infrastructure less safe. Additionally, sustaining road infrastructure through continuous maintenance have greater short term and long-term benefits not only for municipalities but for the society as well. It ultimately improves the transport system infrastructure, furthermore, the impact of deferring road maintenance results in higher repair costs on the long run.  

One of the major issues in maintaining safer roads, is road potholes as it imposes significant risk to safety if left unmaintained. Early detection of potholes can help properly plan road maintenance and improve road safety.  Technology can be used to advance roads maintenance process, making it simple and cost-effective to detect infrastructure problems.
